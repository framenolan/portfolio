# portfolio

Deployed at:  https://framenolan.github.io/portfolio/

This page is a portfolio of my work as a web developer. It showcases my contact information, some information about me, and 5 links to examples of my work.

The page also showcases my use of media queries for a responsive layout, and flexbox features for easy organization.

The About Me and links to portfolio work are currently placeholders, which will be completed as I build out my portfolio.
